There are also some types of identity theft like:

Stolen Identities: Criminals can steal your personal information to pretend to be you, especially to steal money or do other 
                   illegal things.

Data Breaches: People can hack into computer systems to steal sensitive information like your secret passwords,
               credit card numbers or other important details.

Legal Consequences: Identity theft can lead to serious problems with the law, like being accused of doing something you didn't do.

known are HACKERS. 
                  So what do really hackers do? They use who use hacking techniques, which are like sneaky tricks, to get into 
computer systems, networks, or data without permission. They do this with bad intentions. People can really get affected by it 
like for indivisuals, Hackers might target their personal computers or devices. In Businesses, Hackers could steal company secrets or 
disrupt business operations. Where as in critical infrastructure like hospitals, power systems, etc, hackers could affect these areas 
which can also affect people's safety. It can also lead to many financial losses, ranging from indivisuals to big
companies/organisations.

Slide 9: Cyber Security Fundamentals
This is how we protect ourselves and our information online!

1. Understanding Threats: It's important to know the different dangers online, like malware, phishing, hacking, and data breaches. 
   Imagine learning about different types of germs so you know how to stay healthy.
2. Implementing Robust Security Measures: Just like a house needs strong walls and locks, computers need protection like firewalls, 
   antivirus software, and encryption.
3. Fostering Security Awareness: Everyone needs to learn how to stay safe online, like spotting phishing attempts and using strong 
   passwords.
4. Protecting Sensitive Data: Always back up important information, so you don’t lose it if something bad happens. 
   Imagine having spare keys just in case you lose the original.

Slide 10: Protecting Yourself from Cyber Threats
Here are some ways to stay safe online:●
1) Enable Two-Factor Authentication: This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts, like having two locks on your door! 
   It usually involves a password and a special code.●
2) Use Strong and Unique Passwords: Make sure your passwords are long, tricky and different for each account. 
  Think of it like having a different key for each of your valuable things.●
